# qcnn-var

This repository contains data used for our preprint "[On measurement-dependent variance in quantum neural networks
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08029)", as well as the code for obtaining these data.

The plots from the preprint can be obtained using Jupyter notebooks in the Results folder.

The code for numerical simulations is in the notebooks ham-jax.ipynb and lin_comb-jax.ipynb.
